  Exercise 1: Wholemeal programming
  Reimplement each of the following functions in a more idiomatic Haskell style. 
  Use wholemeal programming practices, breaking each function into a pipeline of incremental transformations to an entire data structure.
  Name your functions fun1â€™ and fun2â€™ respectively.

  Hint: For this problem you may wish to use the functions iterate and takeWhile.
  Look them up in the Prelude documentation to see what they do.
